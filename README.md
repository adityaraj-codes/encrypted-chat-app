## 📘 Overview  
**NOVA** is a Python-based **secure chat application** that allows multiple users to communicate safely over a local network.  
It uses **socket programming** for client-server communication and **RSA encryption** to ensure that all transmitted messages are **secure and private**.  
The app also features a sleek **CustomTkinter** GUI for an enhanced user experience.

## ⚙️ Features  
✅ End-to-End Encryption using RSA  
✅ Multi-client support (multiple users can chat simultaneously)  
✅ Dynamic Public Key Exchange between all clients  
✅ Modern, Dark-Themed UI with **CustomTkinter**  
✅ User Login screen  
✅ Message bubbles for sent/received messages  
✅ Real-time updates for connected users

## 🚀 How to Run  

### 1️⃣ Install Requirements  
Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed, then run:  
```bash
pip install customtkinter pycryptodome
```

### 2️⃣ Start the Server
Run the server on your host machine:
```bash
python server.py
```
You should see:
```[LISTENING] Server running on 127.0.0.1:5050```

### 3️⃣ Start the Client(s)
Run the client on one or more devices (same network):
```bash
python client.py
```
Each client will:
+ Show a Login screen
+ Ask for a Username
+ Then load the **Nova** UI

### 4️⃣ Chat Securely!
+ Type your message and press Send.
+ The message is encrypted using RSA with the recipient’s public key.
+ The server only routes messages — it cannot read them.
+ The recipient decrypts messages with their private key.
---

## 💬 How It Works  

1️⃣ **RSA Key Generation**  
Each client generates its own RSA key pair when started.  
The **public key** is sent to the server, while the **private key** stays securely with the client.  

2️⃣ **Public Key Exchange**  
The server distributes all clients’ public keys to each other, ensuring that every user can encrypt messages for others.  

3️⃣ **Encrypted Messaging**  
Messages are encrypted using the recipient’s public key before being sent.  
Only the recipient can decrypt them using their private key — even the server can’t read the message.  

4️⃣ **Threaded Communication**  
Each client runs in a separate thread, allowing smooth, real-time chatting without freezing the GUI.

## 🧠 Example Run  

**Server Terminal**
```pgsql
[LISTENING] Server running on 127.0.0.1:5050
[NEW CONNECTION] ('127.0.0.1', 50250) as Adi
[NEW CONNECTION] ('127.0.0.1', 50251) as Lucky
```

**Client Window**
```pgsql
Welcome Adi! Secure chat initialized.
Lucky joined the chat!
You: hi
Lucky: [Encrypted Message]

```

### 📦 Future Enhancements
+ Hybrid RSA + AES encryption for faster performance
+ File transfer between users
+ Timestamped messages and delivery receipts
+ User authentication (username + password)
+ Cloud deployment for remote access
